1D Forward Simulation for a Susceptible and Chargeable Earth
============================================================

Here we use the module *simpeg.electromangetics.frequency_domain_1d* to compare
predicted frequency domain data for a single sounding when the Earth is
purely conductive, conductive and magnetically susceptible, and when it is chargeable.
In this tutorial, we focus on:

    - Defining receivers, sources and the survey
    - Defining physical properties when the Earth is chargeable and/or magnetically susceptibility
    - Setting physical property values as constant in the simulation

Our survey geometry consists of a vertical magnetic dipole source
located 30 m above the Earth's surface. The receiver is offset
10 m horizontally from the source.

# imaginary ppm data.

frequencies = np.logspace(0, 8, 41)

# as separate receivers.

# Defining a Layered Earth Model
# ------------------------------
#
# Here, we define the layer thicknesses and physical properties for our
# 1D simulation. If we have N layers, parameters for the physical properties
# must be defined for each layer and we must provide N-1 layer thicknesses.
# The lowest layer is assumed to extend to infinity.
#
# For this tutorial, we predict the response for a halfspace model, however
# the script has been generalized to work for an arbitrary number of layers.
# If the Earth is a halfspace, the thicknesses could instead be defined by
# an empty array, and each physical property value by an array of length 1.
#

# Layer thicknesses
thicknesses = np.array([20, 40])
n_layer = len(thicknesses) + 1

# In SimPEG, the Cole-Cole model is used to define a frequency-dependent
# electrical conductivity when the Earth is chargeable.
sigma = 1e-2  # infinite conductivity in S/m
eta = 0.8  # intrinsice chargeability [0, 1]
tau = 0.0001  # central time-relaxation constant in seconds
c = 0.8  # phase constant [0, 1]

# Magnetic susceptibility in SI
chi = 0.2

# For each physical property, the parameters must be defined for each layer.
# In this case, we must define all parameters for the Cole-Cole conductivity
# as well as the magnetic susceptibility.
sigma_model = sigma * np.ones(n_layer)
eta_model = eta * np.ones(n_layer)
tau_model = tau * np.ones(n_layer)
c_model = c * np.ones(n_layer)
mu0 = 4 * np.pi * 1e-7
mu_model = mu0 * (1 + chi) * np.ones(n_layer)

# Here, we let the infinite conductivity be the model. As a result, we only
# need to define the mapping for this parameter. All other parameters used
# to define physical properties will be fixed when creating the simulation.

# Define the Forward Simulation and Predict Data
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# Here we predict the FDEM sounding for several halfspace models
# (conductive, susceptible, chargeable). Since the physical properties defining
# the Earth are different, it requires a separate simulation object be created
# for each case. Each simulation requires the user
# define the survey, the layer thicknesses and a mapping.
#
# A universal mapping was created by letting sigma be the model. All other
# parameters used to define the physical properties are permanently set when
# defining the simulation.
#
# When using the *simpeg.electromagnetics.frequency_domain_1d* module, note that
# predicted data are organized by source, then by receiver, then by frequency.
