"""
3D Forward Simulation for Transient Response on a Cylindrical Mesh
==================================================================

Here we use the module *SimPEG.electromagnetics.time_domain* to simulate the
transient response for borehole survey using a cylindrical mesh and a 
radially symmetric conductivity. For this tutorial, we focus on the following:

    - How to define the transmitters and receivers
    - How to define the transmitter waveform for a step-off
    - How to define the time-stepping
    - How to define the survey
    - How to solve TDEM problems on a cylindrical mesh
    - The units of the conductivity/resistivity model and resulting data


Please note that we have used a coarse mesh larger time-stepping to shorten the
time of the simulation. Proper discretization in space and time is required to
simulate the fields at each time channel with sufficient accuracy.

# Defining the Waveform
# ---------------------
#
# Under *SimPEG.electromagnetic.time_domain.sources*
# there are a multitude of waveforms that can be defined (VTEM, Ramp-off etc...).
# Here we simulate the response due to a step off waveform where the off-time
# begins at t=0. Other waveforms are discuss in the OcTree simulation example.

# Create Airborne Survey
# ----------------------
#
# Here we define the survey used in our simulation. For time domain
# simulations, we must define the geometry of the source and its waveform. For
# the receivers, we define their geometry, the type of field they measure and the time
# channels at which they measure the field. For this example,
# the survey consists of a borehold survey with a coincident loop geometry.

# Create Cylindrical Mesh
# -----------------------

# example. We chose to design a coarser mesh to decrease the run time.
# When designing a mesh to solve practical time domain problems:
#
#     - Your smallest cell size should be 10%-20% the size of your smallest diffusion distance
#     - The thickness of your padding needs to be 2-3 times biggest than your largest diffusion distance
#     - The diffusion distance is ~1260*np.sqrt(rho*t)
