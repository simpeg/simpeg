"""
1D Forward Simulation with Chargeable and/or Magnetic Viscosity
===============================================================

Here we use the module *simpeg.electromangetics.time_domain_1d* to compare
predicted time domain data for a single sounding when the Earth is
purely conductive, chargeable and/or magnetically viscous.
In this tutorial, we focus on:

    - Defining receivers, sources, waveform and the survey
    - Defining physical properties when the Earth is chargeable and/or magnetically viscous
    - Setting physical property values as constant in the simulation

Our survey geometry consists of a horizontal loop source with a radius of 10 m
located 0.5 m above the Earth's surface. The receiver is located at the centre
of the loop and measures the vertical component of the response.

# Defining a 1D Layered Earth Model
# ---------------------------------
#
# Here, we define the layer thicknesses and physical properties for our
# 1D simulation. If we have N layers, parameters for the physical properties
# must be defined for each layer and we must provide N-1 layer thicknesses.
# The lowest layer is assumed to extend to infinity.
#
# For this tutorial, we predict the response for a halfspace model, however
# the script has been generalized to work for an arbitrary number of layers.
# If the Earth is a halfspace, the thicknesses could instead be defined by
# an empty array, and each physical property value by an array of length 1.
#

# Layer thicknesses

# electrical conductivity when the Earth is chargeable.

# magnetic viscosity

dchi = 0.001  # amplitude of frequency-dependent susceptibility contribution
tau1 = 1e-7  # lower limit for time relaxation constants in seconds
tau2 = 1.0  # upper limit for time relaxation constants in seconds


# For each physical property, the parameters must be defined for each layer.
# In this case, we must define all parameters for the Cole-Cole conductivity
# as well as the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility.
