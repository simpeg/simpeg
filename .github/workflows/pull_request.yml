# =========
# IMPORTANT
# =========
#
# TL;DR:
#     THIS ACTION SHOULD NOT RUN ANY CODE FROM THE PR BRANCH.
#
# This action is triggered after new events in Pull Requests (as the
# `pull_request` trigger does), but this ones provides the workflow writing
# permissions to the repo.
# The second checkout step in each job checks out code from the PR branch.
# Code from any PR branch should be treated as malicious!
# Therefore, these action **SHOULD NOT RUN ANY CODE** from the PR branch since
# the workflow has writting permisions.
# Doing so introduces a high severity vulnerability that could be exploited to
# gain access to secrets and/or introduce malicious code.
#
# For this particular workflow we need the writting permission in order for
# reviewdog to publish comments in the PR.
# zizmor will complain about the `pull_request_target` trigger, so we will
# ignore it.
#
# Worth noting that the runner will execute the steps specified in the version
# of this workflow file that lives in the **target branch** (usually `main`),
# not the one in the Pull Request branch. This means that even if a contributor
# opens a PR with a change to this file, the change won't be executed. This is
# intended to prevent third-party contributors from running custom code with high
# privileges on the repo.
