SimPEG 0.15.1 Release Notes
===========================

August 27th, 2021

This patch release contains several small bug fixes and improvements to the code base.

Updates
=======
We now have a simple depth weighting function that can be used as cell weights for
inversions. It is based off of the common potential fields definition:

.. code-block:: python

    wz = 1/(z - z_0)**(q/2)

The way SimPEG handles the definition of standard deviation calculated from the mix
of relative error and noise levels is slightly changed to respect a more statistically
accurate combination of the two components. It is now:

.. code-block:: python

    standard_deviation = sqrt(noise_level**2 + (relative_error * abs(d_obs))**2)

In addition,

* Removed a bit of dead code
* Fixed some typos in documentation
* Removed all references to old numpy matrix class and replaced with
  appropriate array functions.
* Added clarification to the gravity examples explaining why SimPEG's gravity module
  looks backwards.
* removed some internal references to deprecated properties
