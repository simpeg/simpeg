Updates
=======

New features
------------

Gravity simulation using Choclo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can use a faster and more memory efficient implementation of the gravity
simulation ``simpeg.potential_fields.gravity.Simulation3DIntegral``, making use
of Choclo and Numba.  To make use of this functionality you will need to
`install Choclo <https://www.fatiando.org/choclo/latest/install.html>`__ in
addition to ``SimPEG``.

See https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/pull/1285.

Use Dask with MetaSimulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new ``simpeg.meta.DaskMetaSimulation`` class has been added that allows to
use Dask with ``simpeg.meta.MetaSimulations``.

See https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/pull/1199.

Rotated Gradients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added a new ``simpeg.regularization.SmoothnessFullGradient`` regularization
class that allows to regularize first order smoothness along any arbitrary
direction, enabling anisotropic weighting. This regularization also works for
a ``SimplexMesh``.

See https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/pull/1167.

Logistic Sigmoid Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New ``simpeg.map.LogisticSigmoidMap`` mapping class that computes the logistic
sigmoid of the model parameters. This is an alternative method to incorporate
upper and lower bounds on model parameters.

See https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/pull/1352.

Create Jacobian matrix in NSEM and FDEM simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The frequency domain electromagnetic simulations (including natural source) now
support creating and storing the Jacobian matrix. You can access it by using
the ``getJ`` method.

See https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/pull/1276.


Documentation
-------------

This new release includes major improvements in documentation pages: more
detailed docstrings of classes and methods, the addition of directive classes
to the API reference, improvements to the contributing guide, among corrections
and fixes.


Breaking changes
----------------

Removal of deprecated bits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several deprecated bits of code has been removed in this release. From old
classes, methods and properties that were marked for deprecation a few releases
back. These removals simplify the SimPEG API and cleans up the codebase.

Remove factor of half in data misfits and regularizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simplify the definition of data misfit and regularization terms by removing the
leading factor of one half from these functions. This change makes it easier to
interpret the resulting values of these objective functions, while
avoiding confusions with their definition.

See https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/pull/1326.
