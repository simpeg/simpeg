What's SimPEG?
==============

SimPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics) is a
**Python library** for simulations, inversions and parameter estimation for
geophysical applications.

The vision is to create a package for finite volume simulation with
applications to geophysical imaging and subsurface flow. To enable the
understanding of the many different components, this package has the following
features:

* Modular with respect to the spacial discretization, optimization routine, and
  geophysical problem.
* Built with the inverse problem in mind.
* Provides a framework for geophysical and hydrogeologic problems.
* Supports 1D, 2D and 3D problems.
* Designed for large-scale inversions.
