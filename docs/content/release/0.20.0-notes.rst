August 9th, 2023

This minor release contains many bugfixes and additions to the code base, including improvements to
documentation for regularization.

Updates
=======

Spontaneous Potential
---------------------
The spontaneous (self) potential module has finally been re-implemented into the
simulation framework of simpeg 0.14.0. Check out the new module at
:py:mod:`simpeg.electromagnetics.static.spontaneous_potential`.

MVI inversions
--------------
There are now two new support regularization functions relevant to vector inversions in
the cartesian domain. an amplitude based regularization, and a direction based regularization,
which both support reference models.

FDEM
----
The frequency domain simulations now support forward modeling with electrical permittivity as a property

Flake8 improvements
-------------------
We continue to add improvements to the internal code structures to be more in line with
flake8 practices.

MetaSimulation
--------------
There is now a multiprocessing version of the `MetaSimulation` class for interested users
to experiment with.

Documentation
-------------
We've made substantial additions to the regularization documentation.

We have also updated the getting started guides to represent current recommend
practices for installing, developing with, and contributing to SimPEG.

Others
------
We've added support for taking derivatives of anisotropic models, which also fixed derivatives of
properties on tetrahedral and curvilinear meshes.

Invertible properties may now be not required for certain simulations (e.g. permittivity in
a FDEM simulation).

Last but not least, there are of course many bugfixes!
