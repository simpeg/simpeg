Maps: ComboMaps
===============

We will use an example where we want a 1D layered earth as our model,
but we want to map this to a 2D discretization to do our forward
modeling. We will also assume that we are working in log conductivity
still, so after the transformation we map to conductivity space.
To do this we will introduce the vertical 1D map
(:class:`SimPEG.Maps.SurjectVertical1D`), which does the first part of
what we just described. The second part will be done by the
:class:`SimPEG.Maps.ExpMap` described above.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    M = Mesh.TensorMesh([7,5])
    v1dMap = Maps.SurjectVertical1D(M)
    expMap = Maps.ExpMap(M)
    myMap = expMap * v1dMap
    m = np.r_[0.2,1,0.1,2,2.9] # only 5 model parameters!
    sig = myMap * m

If you noticed, it was pretty easy to combine maps. What is even cooler
is that the derivatives also are made for you (if everything goes
right). Just to be sure that the derivative is correct, you should
always run the test on the mapping that you create.
