Code style
==========

Consistency makes code more readable and easier for collaborators to jump in.
SimPEG uses Black_ to autoformat its codebase, and flake8_ to lint its code and
enforce style rules. Black_ can automatically format SimPEG's codebase to
ensure it complies with Black code style. flake8_ performs style checks, raises
warnings on code that could lead towards bugs, performs checks on consistent
documentation formatting, and identifies poor coding practices.

.. hint::

   If you :ref:`configure pre-commit <configure-pre-commit>`, it will
   automatically run Black and flake8 on every commit.

One can manually run Black_ and flake8_ anytime.
Run ``black`` on SimPEG directories that contain Python source files:

.. code::

   black SimPEG examples tutorials tests

Run ``flake8`` on the whole project with:

.. code::

   flake8

.. important::

   Following code style rules can be challenging for new contributors. These
   rules are meant to ease the development process, not to generate an obstacle
   to contribute. Please, don't hesistate to **ask for help** if your
   contribution raises some flake8 errors. And **feel free to push** code that
   **don't follow our code style 100%** in :ref:`pull-requests`. Other
   developers will be there to help you solve them.

.. note::

   SimPEG is currently not `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
   compliant and is not following all flake8 rules, but we are working towards
   it and would appreciate contributions that do too!
