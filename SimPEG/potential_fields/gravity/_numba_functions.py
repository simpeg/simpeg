    Parameters
    ----------
    receivers : (n_receivers, 3) numpy.ndarray
        Array with the locations of the receivers
    nodes : (n_active_nodes, 3) numpy.ndarray
        Array with the location of the mesh nodes.
    densities : (n_active_cells) numpy.ndarray
        Array with densities of each active cell in the mesh.
    fields : (n_receivers) numpy.ndarray
        Array full of zeros where the gravity fields on each receiver will be
        stored. This could be a preallocated array or a slice of it.
    cell_nodes : (n_active_cells, 8) numpy.ndarray
        Array of integers, where each row contains the indices of the nodes for
        each active cell in the mesh.
    kernel_func : callable
        Kernel function that will be evaluated on each node of the mesh. Choose
        one of the kernel functions in ``choclo.prism``.
    constant_factor : float
        Constant factor that will be used to multiply each element of the
        ``fields`` array.

    Notes
    -----
    The constant factor is applied here to each element of fields because
    it's more efficient than doing it afterwards: it would require to
    index the elements that corresponds to each component.
