class JointTotalVariation(BaseSimilarityMeasure):
    r"""Joint total variation regularization for joint inversion.

    ``JointTotalVariation`` regularization aims to ensure non-zero gradients in the recovered
    model to occur at the same locations for all physical property distributions.
    It assumes structures within each physical property distribution are sparse and
    correlated with one another.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : SimPEG.regularization.RegularizationMesh, discretize.base.BaseMesh
        Mesh on which the regularization is discretized. This is not necessarily
        the same as the mesh on which the simulation is defined.
    active_cells : None, (n_cells, ) numpy.ndarray of bool
        Boolean array defining the set of :py:class:`~.regularization.RegularizationMesh`
        cells that are active in the inversion. If ``None``, all cells are active.
    wire_map : SimPEG.maps.Wires
        Wire map connecting physical properties defined on active cells of the
        :class:`RegularizationMesh`` to the entire model.
    reference_model : None, (n_param, ) numpy.ndarray
        Reference model. If ``None``, the reference model in the inversion is set to
        the starting model.
    units : None, str
        Units for the model parameters. Some regularization classes behave
        differently depending on the units; e.g. 'radian'.
    weights : None, dict
        Weight multipliers to customize the least-squares function. Each key points to a (n_cells, )
        numpy.ndarray that is defined on the :py:class:`~.regularization.RegularizationMesh`.
    eps : float
        Needs documentation!!!

    Notes
    -----
    Consider the case where the model is comprised of two physical properties
    :math:`m_1` and :math:`m_2`. Here, we define the regularization
    function (objective function) for joint total variation as
    (`Haber and Gazit, 2013 <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-013-9232-4>`__):

    .. math::
        \phi (m_1, m_2) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \, w(r) \,
        \Big [ \, \big | \nabla m_1 \big |^2 \, + \, \big | \nabla m_2 \big |^2 \, \Big ]^{1/2} \, dv

    where :math:`w(r)` is a user-defined weighting function.

    For implementation within SimPEG, the regularization function and its variables
    must be discretized onto a `mesh`. The discretized approximation for the regularization
    function (objective function) is given by:

    .. math::
        \phi (m_1, m_2) \approx \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \tilde{w}_i \, \bigg [ \,
        \Big | (\nabla m_1)_i \Big |^2 \, + \, \Big | (\nabla m_2)_i \Big |^2 \, \bigg ]^{1/2}

    where :math:`(\nabla m_1)_i` are the gradients of property :math:`m_1` defined on the mesh and
    :math:`\tilde{w}_i \in \mathbf{\tilde{w}}` are amalgamated weighting constants that 1) account
    for cell dimensions in the discretization and 2) apply any user-defined weighting.

    In practice, we define the model :math:`\mathbf{m}` as a discrete
    vector of the form:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{m} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{m_1} \\ \mathbf{m_2} \end{bmatrix}

    where :math:`\mathbf{m_1}` and :math:`\mathbf{m_2}` are the discrete representations
    of the respective physical properties on the mesh. The discrete regularization function
    is therefore equivalent to an objective function of the form:

    .. math::
        \phi (\mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{2} \, \mathbf{e}^T \Bigg ( \,
        \mathbf{W \, A} \bigg [ \sum_k (\mathbf{G \, m_k})^2 \bigg ] \; + \; \epsilon \mathbf{v}^2
        \, \Bigg )^{1/2}

    where exponents are computed elementwise,

        - :math:`\mathbf{e}` is a vector of 1s,
        - :math:`\mathbf{W}` is the weighting matrix for joint total variation regularization,
        - :math:`\mathbf{A}` averages vectors from faces to cell centers,
        - :math:`\mathbf{G}` is the cell gradient operator (cell centers to faces),
        - :math:`\mathbf{v}` are the cell volumes, and
        - :math:`\epsilon` is a constant added for continuous differentiability (set with the `eps` property),

    **Custom weights and the weighting matrix:**

    Let :math:`\mathbf{w_1, \; w_2, \; w_3, \; ...}` each represent an optional set of
    custom cell weights. The weighting applied within the objective function is given by:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{\tilde{w}} = \mathbf{v} \odot \prod_j \mathbf{w_j}

    where :math:`\mathbf{v}` are the cell volumes.
    The weighting matrix used to apply weights within the regularization is given by:

    .. math::
        \boldsymbol{W} = \textrm{diag} \Big ( \, \mathbf{\tilde{w}}^2 \Big )

    Each set of custom cell weights is stored within a ``dict`` as an (n_cells, )
    ``numpy.ndarray``. The weights can be set all at once during instantiation
    with the `weights` keyword argument as follows:

    >>> reg = JointTotalVariation(
    >>>     mesh, wire_map, weights={'weights_1': array_1, 'weights_2': array_2}
    >>> )

    or set after instantiation using the `set_weights` method:

    >>> reg.set_weights(weights_1=array_1, weights_2=array_2})

    The default weights that account for cell dimensions in the regularization are accessed via:

    >>> reg.get_weights('volume')
