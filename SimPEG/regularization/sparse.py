    however, is not directly used to define the regularization for the inverse problem.

    mesh : SimPEG.regularization.RegularizationMesh, discretize.base.BaseMesh
        Mesh on which the regularization is discretized. This is not necessarily
        the same as the mesh on which the simulation is defined.

        Boolean array defining the set of :py:class:`~.regularization.RegularizationMesh`
        cells that are active in the inversion. If ``None``, all cells are active.

class SparseSmallness(BaseSparse, Smallness):
    r"""Sparse smallness (compactness) regularization.

    ``SparseSmallness`` is used to recover models comprised of compact structures.
    The level of compactness is controlled by the norm within the regularization
    function; with more compact structures being recovered when a smaller norm is used.
    Optionally, custom cell weights can be included to control the degree of compactness
    being enforced throughout different regions the model.

    See the *Notes* section below for a comprehensive description.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : .regularization.RegularizationMesh
        Mesh on which the regularization is discretized. Not the mesh used to
        define the simulation.
    norm : float, (n_cells, ) array_like
        The norm defining sparseness in the regularization function. Use a ``float`` to define
        the same norm for all mesh cells, or define an independent norm for each cell. All norm
        values must be within the interval [0, 2].
    active_cells : None, (n_cells, ) numpy.ndarray of bool
        Boolean array defining the set of :py:class:`~.regularization.RegularizationMesh`
        cells that are active in the inversion. If ``None``, all cells are active.
    mapping : None, SimPEG.maps.BaseMap
        The mapping from the model parameters to the active cells in the inversion.
        If ``None``, the mapping is the identity map.
    reference_model : None, (n_param, ) numpy.ndarray
        Reference model. If ``None``, the reference model in the inversion is set to
        the starting model.
    units : None, str
        Units for the model parameters. Some regularization classes behave
        differently depending on the units; e.g. 'radian'.
    weights : None, dict
        Weight multipliers to customize the least-squares function. Each key points to
        a (n_cells, ) numpy.ndarray that is defined on the
        :py:class:`regularization.RegularizationMesh`.
    irls_scaled : bool
        If ``True``, scale the IRLS weights to preserve magnitude of the regularization function.
        If ``False``, do not scale.
    irls_threshold : float
        Constant added to IRLS weights to ensures stability in the algorithm.

    Notes
    -----
    We define the regularization function (objective function) for sparse smallness (compactness) as:

    .. math::
        \phi (m) = \int_\Omega \, w(r) \,
        \Big | \, m(r) - m^{(ref)}(r) \, \Big |^{p(r)} \, dv

    where :math:`m(r)` is the model, :math:`m^{(ref)}(r)` is the reference model, :math:`w(r)`
    is a user-defined weighting function and :math:`p(r) \in [0,2]` is a parameter which imposes
    sparseness throughout the recovered model. More compact structures are recovered in regions
    where :math:`p` is small. If the same level of sparseness is being imposed everywhere,
    the exponent becomes a constant.

    For implementation within SimPEG, the regularization function and its variables
    must be discretized onto a `mesh`. The discretized approximation for the regularization
    function (objective function) is expressed in linear form as:

    .. math::
        \phi (\mathbf{m}) = \sum_i
        \tilde{w}_i \, \Big | m_i - m_i^{(ref)} \Big |^{p_i}

    where :math:`m_i \in \mathbf{m}` are the discrete model parameters defined on the mesh.
    :math:`\tilde{w}_i \in \mathbf{\tilde{w}}` are amalgamated weighting constants that 1) account
    for cell dimensions in the discretization and 2) apply user-defined weighting.
    :math:`p_i \in \mathbf{p}` define the norm for each cell (set using `norm`).

    It is impractical to work with the general form directly, as its derivatives with respect
    to the model are non-linear and discontinuous. Instead, the iteratively re-weighted
    least-squares (IRLS) approach is used to approximate the sparse norm by iteratively solving
    a set of convex least-squares problems. For IRLS iteration :math:`k`, we define:

    .. math::
        \phi \big (\mathbf{m}^{(k)} \big )
        = \sum_i \tilde{w}_i \, \Big | m_i^{(k)} - m_i^{(ref)} \Big |^{p_i}
        \approx \sum_i \tilde{w}_i \, r_i^{(k)} \Big | m_i^{(k)} - m_i^{(ref)} \Big |^2

    where the IRLS weight :math:`r_i` for iteration :math:`k` is given by:

    .. math::
        r_i^{(k)} = \bigg [ \Big ( m_i^{(k-1)} - m_i^{(ref)} \Big )^2 +
        \epsilon^2 \; \bigg ]^{{p_i}/2 - 1}

    and :math:`\epsilon` is a small constant added for stability (set using `irls_threshold`).
    For the set of model parameters :math:`\mathbf{m}` defined at cell centers, the objective
    function for IRLS iteration :math:`k` can be expressed as follows:

    .. math::
        \phi \big ( \mathbf{m}^{(k)} \big ) \approx \Big \| \,
        \mathbf{W}^{\! (k)} \big [ \mathbf{m}^{(k)} - \mathbf{m}^{(ref)} \big ] \Big \|^2

    where

        - :math:`\mathbf{m}^{(k)}` are the discrete model parameters at iteration :math:`k`,
        - :math:`\mathbf{m}^{(ref)}` is a reference model (optional, set with `reference_model`),
        - :math:`\mathbf{W}^{(k)}` is the weighting matrix for iteration :math:`k`. It applies the IRLS weights, user-defined weighting, and accounts for cell dimensions when the regularization function is discretized.

    **IRLS weights, user-defined weighting and the weighting matrix:**

    Let :math:`\mathbf{w_1, \; w_2, \; w_3, \; ...}` each represent an optional set of
    custom cell weights. And let :math:`\mathbf{r_s}^{\!\! (k)}` represent the IRLS weights
    for iteration :math:`k`. The net weighting applied within the objective function
    is given by:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{w}^{(k)} = \mathbf{r_s}^{\!\! (k)} \odot \mathbf{v} \odot \prod_j \mathbf{w_j}

    where :math:`\mathbf{v}` are the cell volumes.
    For a description of how IRLS weights are updated at every iteration, see the documentation
    for :py:meth:`update_weights`.

    The weighting matrix used to apply the weights is given by:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{W}^{(k)} = \textrm{diag} \Big ( \sqrt{\mathbf{w}^{(k)} \, } \Big )

    Each set of custom cell weights is stored within a ``dict`` as an (n_cells, )
    ``numpy.ndarray``. The weights can be set all at once during instantiation
    with the `weights` keyword argument as follows:

    >>> reg = SparseSmallness(mesh, weights={'weights_1': array_1, 'weights_2': array_2})

    or set after instantiation using the `set_weights` method:

    >>> reg.set_weights(weights_1=array_1, weights_2=array_2})

        Mesh on which the regularization is discretized. Not the mesh used to
        define the simulation.
    orientation : {'x','y','z'}
        The direction along which sparse smoothness is applied.
    norm : float, array_like
        The norm defining sparseness thoughout the regularization function. Must be within the
        interval [0,2]. There are several options:

        - ``float``: constant sparse norm throughout the domain.
        - (n_faces, ) ``array_like``: define the sparse norm independently at each face set by `orientation` (e.g. x-faces).
        - (n_cells, ) ``array_like``: define the sparse norm independently for each cell. Will be averaged to faces specified by `orientation` (e.g. x-faces).

    active_cells : None, (n_cells, ) numpy.ndarray of bool
        Boolean array defining the set of :py:class:`~.regularization.RegularizationMesh`
        cells that are active in the inversion. If ``None``, all cells are active.
    mapping : None, SimPEG.maps.BaseMap
        The mapping from the model parameters to the active cells in the inversion.
        If ``None``, the mapping is the identity map.
    reference_model : None, (n_param, ) numpy.ndarray
        Reference model. If ``None``, the reference model in the inversion is set to
        the starting model. To include the reference model in the regularization, the
        `reference_model_in_smooth` property must be set to ``True``.
    reference_model_in_smooth : bool, optional
        Whether to include the reference model in the smoothness terms.
    units : None, str
        Units for the model parameters. Some regularization classes behave
        differently depending on the units; e.g. 'radian'.
    weights : None, dict
        Custom weights for the least-squares function. Each ``key`` points to
        a ``numpy.ndarray`` that is defined on the :py:class:`regularization.RegularizationMesh`.
        A (n_cells, ) ``numpy.ndarray`` is used to define weights at cell centers, which are
        averaged to the appropriate faces internally when weighting is applied.
        A (n_faces, ) ``numpy.ndarray`` is used to define weights directly on the faces specified
        by the `orientation` input argument.
    irls_scaled : bool
        If ``True``, scale the IRLS weights to preserve magnitude of the regularization function.
        If ``False``, do not scale.
    irls_threshold : float
        Constant added to IRLS weights to ensures stability in the algorithm.
    gradient_type : {"total", "component"}
        Gradient measure used in the IRLS re-weighting. Whether to re-weight using the total
        gradient or components of the gradient.

    Notes
    -----
    The regularization function (objective function) for sparse smoothness (blockiness)
    along the x-direction as:

    .. math::
        \phi (m) = \int_\Omega \, w(r) \,
        \Bigg | \, \frac{\partial m}{\partial x} \, \Bigg |^{p(r)} \, dv

    where :math:`m(r)` is the model, :math:`w(r)`
    is a user-defined weighting function and :math:`p(r) \in [0,2]` is a parameter which imposes
    sparseness throughout the recovered model. Sharper boundaries are recovered in regions
    where :math:`p(r)` is small. If the same level of sparseness is being imposed everywhere,
    the exponent becomes a constant.

    For implementation within SimPEG, the regularization function and its variables
    must be discretized onto a `mesh`. The discrete approximation for the regularization
    function (objective function) is expressed in linear form as:

    .. math::
        \phi (\mathbf{m}) = \sum_i
        \tilde{w}_i \, \Bigg | \, \frac{\partial m_i}{\partial x} \, \Bigg |^{p_i}

    where :math:`m_i \in \mathbf{m}` are the discrete model parameters defined on the mesh.
    :math:`\tilde{w}_i \in \mathbf{\tilde{w}}` are amalgamated weighting constants that 1) account
    for cell dimensions in the discretization and 2) apply user-defined weighting.
    :math:`p_i \in \mathbf{p}` define the norm for each face (set using `norm`).

    It is impractical to work with the general form directly, as its derivatives with respect
    to the model are non-linear and discontinuous. Instead, the iteratively re-weighted
    least-squares (IRLS) approach is used to approximate the sparse norm by iteratively solving
    a set of convex least-squares problems. For IRLS iteration :math:`k`, we define:

    .. math::
        \phi \big (\mathbf{m}^{(k)} \big )
        = \sum_i
        \tilde{w}_i \, \Bigg | \, \frac{\partial m_i^{(k)}}{\partial x} \Bigg |^{p_i}
        \approx \sum_i \tilde{w}_i \, r_i^{(k)}
        \Bigg | \, \frac{\partial m_i^{(k)}}{\partial x} \Bigg |^2

    where the IRLS weight :math:`r_i` for iteration :math:`k` is given by:

    .. math::
        r_i^{(k)} = \Bigg [ \Bigg ( \frac{\partial m_i^{(k-1)}}{\partial x} \Bigg )^2 +
        \epsilon^2 \; \Bigg ]^{{p_i}/2 - 1}

    and :math:`\epsilon` is a small constant added for stability (set using `irls_threshold`).
    For the set of model parameters :math:`\mathbf{m}` defined at cell centers, the objective
    function for IRLS iteration :math:`k` can be expressed as follows:

    .. math::
        \phi \big ( \mathbf{m}^{(k)} \big ) \approx \Big \| \,
        \mathbf{W}^{(k)} \, \mathbf{G_x} \, \mathbf{m}^{(k)} \Big \|^2

    where

        - :math:`\mathbf{m}^{(k)}` are the discrete model parameters at iteration :math:`k`,
        - :math:`\mathbf{G_x}` is the partial cell-gradient operator along x (x-derivative),
        - :math:`\mathbf{W}^{(k)}` is the weighting matrix for iteration :math:`k`. It applies the IRLS weights, user-defined weighting, and accounts for cell dimensions when the regularization function is discretized.

    Note that since :math:`\mathbf{G_x}` maps from cell centers to x-faces, the weighting matrix
    acts on variables living on x-faces.

    **Reference model in smoothness:**

    Gradients/interfaces within a discrete reference model :math:`\mathbf{m}^{(ref)}` can be
    preserved by including the reference model the smoothness regularization.
    In this case, the least-squares problem for IRLS iteration :math:`k` becomes:

    .. math::
        \phi \big ( \mathbf{m}^{(k)} \big ) \approx \Big \| \,
        \mathbf{W}^{(k)} \mathbf{G_x}
        \big [ \mathbf{m}^{(k)} - \mathbf{m}^{(ref)} \big ] \Big \|^2

    This functionality is used by setting :math:`\mathbf{m}^{(ref)}` with the
    `reference_model` property, and by setting the `reference_model_in_smooth` parameter
    to ``True``.

    **IRLS weights, user-defined weighting and the weighting matrix:**

    Let :math:`\mathbf{w_1, \; w_2, \; w_3, \; ...}` each represent an optional set of
    custom weights defined on the faces specified by the `orientation` property;
    i.e. x-faces for smoothness along the x-direction. Each set of weights were either defined
    directly on the faces or have been averaged from cell centers. And let
    :math:`\mathbf{r_x}^{\!\! (k)}` represent the IRLS weights for iteration :math:`k`.
    The net weighting applied within the objective function is given by:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{w}^{(k)} = \mathbf{r_x}^{\!\! (k)} \odot \mathbf{v_x} \odot \prod_j \mathbf{w_j}

    where :math:`\mathbf{v_x}` are cell volumes projected to x-faces; i.e. where the
    x-derivative lives. For a description of how IRLS weights are updated at every iteration,
    see the documentation for :py:meth:`update_weights`.

    The weighting matrix used to apply the weights is given by:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{W}^{(k)} = \textrm{diag} \Big ( \sqrt{\mathbf{w}^{(k)} \, } \Big )

    Each set of custom weights is stored within a ``dict`` as an ``numpy.ndarray``.
    A (n_cells, ) ``numpy.ndarray`` is used to define weights at cell centers, which are
    averaged to the appropriate faces internally when weighting is applied.
    A (n_faces, ) ``numpy.ndarray`` is used to define weights directly on the faces specified
    by the `orientation` input argument. The weights can be set all at once during instantiation
    with the `weights` keyword argument as follows:

    >>> array_1 = np.ones(mesh.n_cells)  # weights at cell centers
    >>> array_2 = np.ones(mesh.n_faces_x)  # weights directly on x-faces
    >>> reg = SparseSmoothness(
    >>>     mesh, orientation='x', weights={'weights_1': array_1, 'weights_2': array_2}

    or set after instantiation using the `set_weights` method:

        Parameters
        ----------

            The model used to update the IRLS weights.

        Notes
        -----
        Let us consider the IRLS weights for sparse smoothness along the x-direction.
        When the class property `gradient_type`=`'components'`, IRLS weights are computed
        using the regularization kernel function and we define:

        .. math::
            \mathbf{f_m} = \mathbf{G_x} \big [ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m}^{(ref)} \big ]

        where :math:`\mathbf{m}` is the model provided, :math:`\mathbf{G_x}` is the partial cell
        gradient operator along x (i.e. x-derivative), and :math:`\mathbf{m}^{(ref)}` is a
        reference model (optional, activated using `reference_model_in_smooth`).
        See :py:meth:`SmoothnessFirstOrder.f_m` for a more comprehensive definition of the
        regularization kernel function.

        However, when the class property `gradient_type`=`'total'`, IRLS weights are computed
        using the magnitude of the total gradient and we define:

        .. math::
            \mathbf{{f}_m} = \mathbf{A_{cx}} \sum_{j=x,y,z} \Big | \mathbf{A_j G_j}
            \big [ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m}^{(ref)} \big ] \Big |

        where :math:`\mathbf{A_j}` for :math:`j=x,y,z` averages the partial gradients from their
        respective faces to cell centers, and :math:`\mathbf{A_{cx}}` averages the sum of the
        absolute values back to the appropriate faces.

        Once :math:`\mathbf{f_m}` is obtained, the IRLS weights are computed via:

        .. math::
            \mathbf{w_r} = \boldsymbol{\lambda} \oslash
            \Big [ \mathbf{f_m}^{\!\! 2} + \epsilon^2 \Big ]^{1 - \mathbf{p}/2}

        where :math:`\oslash` represents elementwise division, :math:`\epsilon` is a small
        constant added for stability of the algorithm (set using the `irls_threshold` property),
        and :math:`\mathbf{p}` defines the norm for each element (set using the `norm` property).

        :math:`\boldsymbol{\lambda}` applies optional scaling to the IRLS weights
        (when the `irls_scaled` property is ``True``).
        The scaling acts to preserve the balance between the data misfit and the components of
        the regularization based on the derivative of the l2-norm measure. And it assists the
        convergence by ensuring the model does not deviate
        aggressively from the global 2-norm solution during the first few IRLS iterations.

        To apply the scaling, let

        .. math::
            f_{max} = \big \| \, \mathbf{f_m} \, \big \|_\infty

        and define a vector array :math:`\mathbf{\tilde{f}_{\! max}}` such that:

        .. math::
            \tilde{f}_{\! i,max} = \begin{cases}
            f_{max} \;\;\;\;\; for \; p_i \geq 1 \\
            \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{1 - p_i}} \;\;\; for \; p_i < 1
            \end{cases}

        The scaling vector :math:`\boldsymbol{\lambda}` is:

        .. math::
            \boldsymbol{\lambda} = \Bigg [ \frac{f_{max}}{\mathbf{\tilde{f}_{max}}} \Bigg ]
            \odot \Big [ \mathbf{\tilde{f}_{max}}^{\!\! 2} + \epsilon^2 \Big ]^{1 - \mathbf{p}/2}

    Apply regularization for recovering compact and/or blocky structures
    using a weighted sum of :class:`SparseSmallness` and :class:`SparseSmoothness`
    regularization functions. The level of compactness and blockiness is
    controlled by the norms within the respective regularization functions;
    with more sparse structures (compact and/or blocky) being recovered when smaller
    norms are used. Optionally, custom cell weights can be applied to control
    the degree of sparseness being enforced throughout different regions the model.

    See the *Notes* section below for a comprehensive description.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : SimPEG.regularization.RegularizationMesh, discretize.base.BaseMesh

        Boolean array defining the set of :py:class:`~.regularization.RegularizationMesh`
        cells that are active in the inversion. If ``None``, all cells are active.

    Notes
    -----
    Sparse regularization can be defined by a weighted sum of
    :class:`SparseSmallness`  and :class:`SparseSmoothness`
    regularization functions. This corresponds to a model objective function
    :math:`\phi_m (m)` of the form:

    .. math::
        \phi_m (m) = \alpha_s \int_\Omega \, w(r)
        \Big | \, m(r) - m^{(ref)}(r) \, \Big |^{p_s(r)} \, dv
        + \sum_{j=x,y,z} \alpha_j \int_\Omega \, w(r)
        \Bigg | \, \frac{\partial m}{\partial \xi_j} \, \Bigg |^{p_j(r)} \, dv

    where :math:`m(r)` is the model, :math:`m^{(ref)}(r)` is the reference model, and :math:`w(r)`
    is a user-defined weighting function applied to all terms.
    :math:`\xi_j` for :math:`j=x,y,z` are unit directions along :math:`j`.
    Parameters :math:`\alpha_s` and :math:`\alpha_j` for :math:`j=x,y,z` are multiplier constants
    that weight the respective contributions of the smallness and smoothness terms in the
    regularization. :math:`p_s(r) \in [0,2]` is a parameter which imposes sparse smallness
    throughout the recovered model; where more compact structures are recovered in regions where
    :math:`p_s(r)` is small. And :math:`p_j(r) \in [0,2]` for :math:`j=x,y,z` are parameters which
    impose sparse smoothness throughout the recovered model along the specified direction;
    where sharper boundaries are recovered in regions where these parameters are small.

    For implementation within SimPEG, regularization functions and their variables
    must be discretized onto a `mesh`. For a regularization function whose kernel is given by
    :math:`f(r)`, we approximate as follows:

    .. math::
        \int_\Omega w(r) \big [ f(r) \big ]^{p(r)} \, dv \approx \sum_i \tilde{w}_i \, | f_i |^{p_i}

    where :math:`f_i \in \mathbf{f_m}` define the discrete regularization kernel function
    on the mesh. For example, the regularization kernel function for smallness regularization
    is:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{f_m}(\mathbf{m}) = \mathbf{m - m}^{(ref)}

    :math:`\tilde{w}_i \in \mathbf{\tilde{w}}` are amalgamated weighting constants that 1) account
    for cell dimensions in the discretization and 2) apply user-defined weighting.
    :math:`p_i \in \mathbf{p}` define the sparseness throughout the domain (set using `norm`).

    It is impractical to work with sparse norms directly, as their derivatives with respect
    to the model are non-linear and discontinuous. Instead, the iteratively re-weighted
    least-squares (IRLS) approach is used to approximate sparse norms by iteratively solving
    a set of convex least-squares problems. For IRLS iteration :math:`k`, we define:

    .. math::
        \sum_i \tilde{w}_i \, \Big | f_i^{(k)} \Big |^{p_i}
        \approx \sum_i \tilde{w}_i \, r_i^{(k)} \Big | f_i^{(k)} \Big |^2

    where the IRLS weight :math:`r_i` for iteration :math:`k` is given by:

    .. math::
        r_i^{(k)} = \bigg [ \Big ( f_i^{(k-1)} \Big )^2 + \epsilon^2 \; \bigg ]^{p_i/2 - 1}

    and :math:`\epsilon` is a small constant added for stability (set using `irls_threshold`).
    For the set of model parameters :math:`\mathbf{m}` defined at cell centers, the model
    objective function for IRLS iteration :math:`k` can be expressed as a weighted sum of
    objective functions of the form:

    .. math::
        \phi_m (\mathbf{m}) = \alpha_s
        \Big \| \mathbf{W_s}^{\!\! (k)} \big [ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m}^{(ref)} \big ] \Big \|^2
        + \sum_{j=x,y,z} \alpha_j \Big \| \mathbf{W_j}^{\! (k)} \mathbf{G_j \, m} \Big \|^2

    where

        - :math:`\mathbf{m}` are the set of discrete model parameters (i.e. the model),
        - :math:`\mathbf{m}^{(ref)}` is the reference model,
        - :math:`\mathbf{G_x, \, G_y, \; G_z}` are partial cell gradients operators along x, y and z, and
        - :math:`\mathbf{W_s, \, W_x, \, W_y, \; W_z}` are the weighting matrices for iteration :math:`k`.

    The weighting matrices apply the IRLS weights, user-defined weighting, and account for cell
    dimensions when the regularization functions are discretized.

    **IRLS weights, user-defined weighting and the weighting matrix:**

    Let :math:`\mathbf{w_1, \; w_2, \; w_3, \; ...}` each represent an optional set of custom cell
    weights that are applied to all objective functions in the model objective function.
    For IRLS iteration :math:`k`, the general form for the weights applied to the sparse smallness
    term is given by:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{w_s}^{\!\! (k)} = \mathbf{r_s}^{\!\! (k)} \odot
        \mathbf{v} \odot \prod_j \mathbf{w_j}

    And for sparse smoothness along x (likewise for y and z) is given by:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{w_x}^{\!\! (k)} = \mathbf{r_x}^{\!\! (k)} \odot \big ( \mathbf{P_x \, v} \big )
        \odot \prod_j \mathbf{P_x \, w_j}

    The IRLS weights at iteration :math:`k` are defined as :math:`\mathbf{r_\ast}^{\!\! (k)}`
    for :math:`\ast = s,x,y,z`. :math:`\mathbf{v}` are the cell volumes.
    Operators :math:`\mathbf{P_\ast}` for :math:`\ast = x,y,z`
    project to the appropriate faces.

    Once the net weights for all objective functions are computed,
    their weighting matrices can be constructed via:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{W}_\ast^{(k)} = \textrm{diag} \Big ( \, \sqrt{\mathbf{w_\ast}^{\!\! (k)} \, } \Big )

    Each set of custom cell weights is stored within a ``dict`` as an (n_cells, )
    ``numpy.ndarray``. The weights can be set all at once during instantiation
    with the `weights` keyword argument as follows:

    >>> reg = Sparse(mesh, weights={'weights_1': array_1, 'weights_2': array_2})

    or set after instantiation using the `set_weights` method:

    >>> reg.set_weights(weights_1=array_1, weights_2=array_2})

    **Reference model in smoothness:**

    Gradients/interfaces within a discrete reference model can be preserved by including the
    reference model the smoothness regularization. In this case,
    the objective function becomes:

    .. math::
        \phi_m (\mathbf{m}) = \alpha_s
        \Big \| \mathbf{W_s}^{\! (k)} \big [ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m}^{(ref)} \big ] \Big \|^2
        + \sum_{j=x,y,z} \alpha_j \Big \|
        \mathbf{W_j}^{\! (k)} \mathbf{G_j} \big [ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m}^{(ref)} \big ] \Big \|^2

    This functionality is used by setting the `reference_model_in_smooth` parameter
    to ``True``.

    **Alphas and length scales:**

    The :math:`\alpha` parameters scale the relative contributions of the smallness and smoothness
    terms in the model objective function. Each :math:`\alpha` parameter can be set directly as an
    appropriate property of the ``WeightedLeastSquares`` class; e.g. :math:`\alpha_x` is set
    using the `alpha_x` property. Note that unless the parameters are set manually, second-order
    smoothness is not included in the model objective function. That is, the `alpha_xx`, `alpha_yy`
    and `alpha_zz` parameters are set to 0 by default.

    The relative contributions of smallness and smoothness terms on the recovered model can also
    be set by leaving `alpha_s` as its default value of 1, and setting the smoothness scaling
    constants based on length scales. The model objective function has been formulated such that
    smallness and smoothness terms contribute equally when the length scales are equal; i.e. when
    properties `length_scale_x = length_scale_y = length_scale_z`. When the `length_scale_x`
    property is set, the `alpha_x` and `alpha_xx` properties are set internally as:

    >>> reg.alpha_x = (reg.length_scale_x * reg.regularization_mesh.base_length) ** 2.0

    and

    >>> reg.alpha_xx = (ref.length_scale_x * reg.regularization_mesh.base_length) ** 4.0

    Likewise for y and z.
