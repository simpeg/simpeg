    """Get indices of active cells from topography.

    For a mesh and surface topography, this function returns the indices of cells
    lying below the discretized surface topography.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : discretize.TensorMesh or discretize.TreeMesh
        Mesh on which you want to identify active cells
    topo : (n, 3) numpy.ndarray
        Topography data as a ``numpyndarray`` with columns [x,y,z]; can use [x,z] for 2D meshes.
        Topography data can be unstructured.
    gridLoc : str {'CC', 'N'}
        If 'CC', all cells whose centers are below the topography are active cells.
        If 'N', then cells must lie entirely below the topography in order to be active cells.
    method : str {'nearest','linear'}
        Interpolation method for approximating topography at cell's horizontal position.
        Default is 'nearest'.
    fill_value : float
        Defines the elevation for cells outside the horizontal extent of the topography data.
        Default is :py:class:`numpy.nan`.

    Returns
    -------
    (n_active) numpy.ndarray of int
        Indices of active cells below xyz.

def depth_weighting(
    mesh, reference_locs, active_cells=None, exponent=2.0, threshold=None, **kwargs
):
    r"""
    Construct diagonal elements of a depth weighting matrix

    Builds the model weights following the depth weighting strategy, a method
    to generate weights based on the vertical distance between mesh cell
    centers and some reference location(s).
    Use these weights in regularizations to counteract the natural decay of
    potential field data with depth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : discretize.base.BaseMesh
        Discretized model space.
    reference_locs : float or (n, ndim) numpy.ndarray
        Reference location for the depth weighting.
        It can be a ``float``, which value is the vertical component for
        the reference location.
        Or it can be a 2d array, with multiple reference locations, where each
        row should contain the coordinates of a single location point in the
        following order: _x_, _y_, _z_ (for 3D meshes) or _x_, _z_ (for 2D
        meshes).
        The vertical coordinate of the reference location for each cell in the
        mesh will be obtained by the closest point in ``reference_locs`` using
        only their horizontal coordinates.
    active_cells : (mesh.n_cells) numpy.ndarray of bool, optional
        Index vector for the active cells on the mesh.
        If ``None``, every cell will be assumed to be active.
    exponent : float, optional
        Exponent parameter for depth weighting.
        The exponent should match the natural decay power of the potential
        field. For example, for gravity acceleration, set it to 2; for magnetic
        fields, to 3.
    threshold : float or None, optional
        Threshold parameters used in the depth weighting.
        If ``None``, it will be set to half of the smallest cell width.

    Returns
    -------
    (n_active) numpy.ndarray
        Normalized depth weights for the mesh at every active cell as
        a 1d-array.

    Notes
    -----
    Each diagonal term of the matrix is defined as:

    .. math::

        w(z) = \frac{1}{(|z - z_0| + \epsilon) ^ {\nu / 2}}

    where :math:`z` is the vertical coordinate of the mesh cell centers,
    :math:`z_0` is the vertical coordinate of the reference location,
    :math:`\nu` is the _exponent_,
    and :math:`\epsilon` is a given _threshold_.

    The depth weights array is finally normalized by dividing for its maximum
    value.
