    About the kernel functions
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    For computing the ``bx`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_ee, kernel_y=kernel_en, kernel_z=kernel_eu


    For computing the ``by`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_en, kernel_y=kernel_nn, kernel_z=kernel_nu

    For computing the ``bz`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_eu, kernel_y=kernel_nu, kernel_z=kernel_uu

    About the model array
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The ``model`` must always be a 1d array:

    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``True``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array with
      the same number of elements as active cells in the mesh. It should store
      the magnetic susceptibilities of each active cell in SI units.
    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``False``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array
      with a number of elements equal to three times the active cells in the
      mesh. It should store the components of the magnetization vector of each
      active cell in :math:`Am^{-1}`. The order in which the components should
      be passed are:
          * every _easting_ component of each active cell,
          * then every _northing_ component of each active cell,
          * and finally every _upward_ component of each active cell.

    About the sensitivity matrix
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Each row of the sensitivity matrix corresponds to a single receiver
    location.

    If ``scalar_model`` is True, then each element of the row will
    correspond to the partial derivative of the selected magnetic component
    with respect to the susceptibility of each cell in the mesh.

    If ``scalar_model`` is False, then each row can be split in three sections
    containing:

    * the partial derivatives of the selected magnetic component with respect
      to the _x_ component of the effective susceptibility of each cell; then
    * the partial derivatives of the selected magnetic component with respect
      to the _y_ component of the effective susceptibility of each cell; and then
    * the partial derivatives of the selected magnetic component with respect
      to the _z_ component of the effective susceptibility of each cell.

    So, if we call :math:`B_j` the magnetic field component on the receiver
    :math:`j`, and :math:`\bar{\chi}^{(i)} = (\chi_x^{(i)}, \chi_y^{(i)},
    \chi_z^{(i)})` the effective susceptibility of the active cell :math:`i`,
    then each row of the sensitivity matrix will be:

    .. math::

        \left[
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_x^{(1)}},
            \dots,
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_x^{(N)}},
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_y^{(1)}},
            \dots,
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_y^{(N)}},
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_z^{(1)}},
            \dots,
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_z^{(N)}}
        \right]

    where :math:`N` is the total number of active cells.

    About the kernel functions
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    To compute the :math:`\alpha` derivative of the TMI :math:`\Delta T` (with
    :math:`\alpha \in \{x, y, z\}` we need to evaluate third order kernels
    functions for the prism. The kernels we need to evaluate can be obtained by
    fixing one of the subindices to the direction of the derivative
    (:math:`\alpha`) and cycle through combinations of the other two.

    For ``tmi_x`` we need to pass:

    .. code::

        kernel_xx=kernel_eee, kernel_yy=kernel_enn, kernel_zz=kernel_euu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_een, kernel_xz=kernel_eeu, kernel_yz=kernel_enu

    For ``tmi_y`` we need to pass:

        kernel_xx=kernel_een, kernel_yy=kernel_nnn, kernel_zz=kernel_nuu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_enn, kernel_xz=kernel_enu, kernel_yz=kernel_nnu

    For ``tmi_z`` we need to pass:

    .. code::

        kernel_xx=kernel_eeu, kernel_yy=kernel_nnu, kernel_zz=kernel_uuu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_enu, kernel_xz=kernel_euu, kernel_yz=kernel_nuu

        Array with the locations of the receivers
    nodes : (n_active_nodes, 3) array
        Array with the location of the mesh nodes.
    cell_nodes : (n_active_cells, 8) array
        Array of integers, where each row contains the indices of the nodes for
        each active cell in the mesh.
    regional_field : (3,) array
        Array containing the x, y and z components of the regional magnetic
        field (uniform background field).
    kernel_x, kernel_y, kernel_z : callable
        Kernels used to compute the desired magnetic component. For example,
        for computing bx we need to use ``kernel_x=kernel_ee``,
        ``kernel_y=kernel_en``, ``kernel_z=kernel_eu``.
    constant_factor : float
        Constant factor that will be used to multiply each element of the
        sensitivity matrix.
    scalar_model : bool
        If True, the sensitivity matrix is built to work with scalar models
        (susceptibilities).
        If False, the sensitivity matrix is built to work with vector models
        (effective susceptibilities).
    vector : (n_receivers) numpy.ndarray
        Array that represents the vector used in the dot product.
    result : (n_active_cells) or (3 * n_active_cells) numpy.ndarray
        Running result array where the output of the dot product will be added to.
        The array should have ``n_active_cells`` elements if ``scalar_model``
        is True, or ``3 * n_active_cells`` otherwise.

    -----
    This function is meant to be run in serial. Writing to the ``result`` array
    inside a parallel loop over the receivers generates a race condition that

        Array with the locations of the receivers
    nodes : (n_active_nodes, 3) array
        Array with the location of the mesh nodes.
    cell_nodes : (n_active_cells, 8) array
        Array of integers, where each row contains the indices of the nodes for
        each active cell in the mesh.
    regional_field : (3,) array
        Array containing the x, y and z components of the regional magnetic
        field (uniform background field).

        Kernel functions used for computing the desired TMI derivative.
    constant_factor : float
        Constant factor that will be used to multiply each element of the
        sensitivity matrix.
    scalar_model : bool
        If True, the sensitivity matrix is build to work with scalar models
        (susceptibilities).
        If False, the sensitivity matrix is build to work with vector models
        (effective susceptibilities).
    vector : (n_receivers) numpy.ndarray
        Array that represents the vector used in the dot product.
    result : (n_active_cells) or (3 * n_active_cells) numpy.ndarray
        Running result array where the output of the dot product will be added to.
        The array should have ``n_active_cells`` elements if ``scalar_model``
        is True, or ``3 * n_active_cells`` otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is meant to be run in serial. Writing to the ``result`` array
    inside a parallel loop over the receivers generates a race condition that
    leads to corrupted outputs.

    constant_factor : float
        Constant factor that will be used to multiply each element of the

    scalar_model : bool
        If True, the sensitivity matrix is build to work with scalar models

        (effective susceptibilities).
    vector : (n_receivers) numpy.ndarray
        Array that represents the vector used in the dot product.
    result : (n_active_cells) or (3 * n_active_cells) numpy.ndarray
        Running result array where the output of the dot product will be added to.
        The array should have ``n_active_cells`` elements if ``scalar_model``
        is True, or ``3 * n_active_cells`` otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is meant to be run in parallel.
    This implementation instructs each thread to allocate their own array for
    the current row of the sensitivity matrix. After computing the elements of
    that row, it gets added to the running ``result`` array through a reduction
    operation handled by Numba.

        Constant factor that will be used to multiply each element of the
        sensitivity matrix.
    scalar_model : bool
        If True, the sensitivity matrix is built to work with scalar models
        (susceptibilities).
        If False, the sensitivity matrix is built to work with vector models
        (effective susceptibilities).
    weights : (n_receivers,) numpy.ndarray
        Array with data weights. It should be the diagonal of the ``W`` matrix,
        squared.
    diagonal : (n_active_cells) or (3 * n_active_cells) numpy.ndarray
        Array where the diagonal of ``G.T @ G`` will be added to.

    About the kernel functions
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    For computing the ``bx`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_ee, kernel_y=kernel_en, kernel_z=kernel_eu


    For computing the ``by`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_en, kernel_y=kernel_nn, kernel_z=kernel_nu

    For computing the ``bz`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_eu, kernel_y=kernel_nu, kernel_z=kernel_uu


    About the model array
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The ``model`` must always be a 1d array:

    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``True``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array with
      the same number of elements as active cells in the mesh. It should store
      the magnetic susceptibilities of each active cell in SI units.
    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``False``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array
      with a number of elements equal to three times the active cells in the
      mesh. It should store the components of the magnetization vector of each
      active cell in :math:`Am^{-1}`. The order in which the components should
      be passed are:
          * every _easting_ component of each active cell,
          * then every _northing_ component of each active cell,
          * and finally every _upward_ component of each active cell.

    About the kernel functions
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    To compute the :math:`\alpha` derivative of the TMI :math:`\Delta T` (with
    :math:`\alpha \in \{x, y, z\}` we need to evaluate third order kernels
    functions for the prism. The kernels we need to evaluate can be obtained by
    fixing one of the subindices to the direction of the derivative
    (:math:`\alpha`) and cycle through combinations of the other two.

    For ``tmi_x`` we need to pass:

    .. code::

        kernel_xx=kernel_eee, kernel_yy=kernel_enn, kernel_zz=kernel_euu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_een, kernel_xz=kernel_eeu, kernel_yz=kernel_enu

    For ``tmi_y`` we need to pass:

        kernel_xx=kernel_een, kernel_yy=kernel_nnn, kernel_zz=kernel_nuu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_enn, kernel_xz=kernel_enu, kernel_yz=kernel_nnu

    For ``tmi_z`` we need to pass:

    About the model array
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The ``model`` must always be a 1d array:

    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``True``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array with
      the same number of elements as active cells in the mesh. It should store
      the magnetic susceptibilities of each active cell in SI units.
    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``False``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array
      with a number of elements equal to three times the active cells in the
      mesh. It should store the components of the magnetization vector of each
      active cell in :math:`Am^{-1}`. The order in which the components should
      be passed are:
          * every _easting_ component of each active cell,
          * then every _northing_ component of each active cell,
          * and finally every _upward_ component of each active cell.

        field (uniform background field).
    forward_func : callable
        Forward function that will be evaluated on each node of the mesh. Choose
        one of the forward functions in ``choclo.prism``.

    About the kernel functions
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    To compute the :math:`\alpha` derivative of the TMI :math:`\Delta T` (with
    :math:`\alpha \in \{x, y, z\}` we need to evaluate third order kernels
    functions for the prism. The kernels we need to evaluate can be obtained by
    fixing one of the subindices to the direction of the derivative
    (:math:`\alpha`) and cycle through combinations of the other two.

    For ``tmi_x`` we need to pass:

    .. code::

        kernel_xx=kernel_eee, kernel_yy=kernel_enn, kernel_zz=kernel_euu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_een, kernel_xz=kernel_eeu, kernel_yz=kernel_enu

    For ``tmi_y`` we need to pass:

    .. code::

        kernel_xx=kernel_een, kernel_yy=kernel_nnn, kernel_zz=kernel_nuu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_enn, kernel_xz=kernel_enu, kernel_yz=kernel_nnu

    For ``tmi_z`` we need to pass:

    .. code::

        kernel_xx=kernel_eeu, kernel_yy=kernel_nnu, kernel_zz=kernel_uuu,
        kernel_xy=kernel_enu, kernel_xz=kernel_euu, kernel_yz=kernel_nuu


    About the model array

        Array with the locations of the receivers
    cells_bounds : (n_active_cells, 4) numpy.ndarray
        Array with the bounds of each active cell in the 2D mesh. For each row, the
        bounds should be passed in the following order: ``x_min``, ``x_max``,
        ``y_min``, ``y_max``.
    top : (n_active_cells) np.ndarray
        Array with the top boundaries of each active cell in the 2D mesh.
    bottom : (n_active_cells) np.ndarray
        Array with the bottom boundaries of each active cell in the 2D mesh.
    sensitivity_matrix : array
        Empty 2d array where the sensitivity matrix elements will be filled.
        This could be a preallocated empty array or a slice of it.
        The array should have a shape of ``(n_receivers, n_active_cells)``
        if ``scalar_model`` is True.

    kernel_x, kernel_y, kernel_z : callable
        Kernels used to compute the desired magnetic component. For example,
        for computing bx we need to use ``kernel_x=kernel_ee``,
        ``kernel_y=kernel_en``, ``kernel_z=kernel_eu``.
    scalar_model : bool
        If True, the sensitivity matrix is built to work with scalar models

        If False, the sensitivity matrix is built to work with vector models
        (effective susceptibilities).

    Notes

    About the kernel functions
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    For computing the ``bx`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_ee, kernel_y=kernel_en, kernel_z=kernel_eu


    For computing the ``by`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_en, kernel_y=kernel_nn, kernel_z=kernel_nu

    For computing the ``bz`` component of the magnetic field we need to use the
    following kernels:

    .. code::

        kernel_x=kernel_eu, kernel_y=kernel_nu, kernel_z=kernel_uu


    About the model array
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The ``model`` must always be a 1d array:

    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``True``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array with
      the same number of elements as active cells in the mesh. It should store
      the magnetic susceptibilities of each active cell in SI units.
    * If ``scalar_model`` is ``False``, then ``model`` should be a 1d array
      with a number of elements equal to three times the active cells in the
      mesh. It should store the components of the magnetization vector of each
      active cell in :math:`Am^{-1}`. The order in which the components should
      be passed are:
          * every _easting_ component of each active cell,
          * then every _northing_ component of each active cell,
          * and finally every _upward_ component of each active cell.

    About the sensitivity matrix
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Each row of the sensitivity matrix corresponds to a single receiver
    location.

    If ``scalar_model`` is True, then each element of the row will
    correspond to the partial derivative of the selected magnetic component
    with respect to the susceptibility of each cell in the mesh.

    If ``scalar_model`` is False, then each row can be split in three sections
    containing:

    * the partial derivatives of the selected magnetic component with respect
      to the _x_ component of the effective susceptibility of each cell; then
    * the partial derivatives of the selected magnetic component with respect
      to the _y_ component of the effective susceptibility of each cell; and then
    * the partial derivatives of the selected magnetic component with respect
      to the _z_ component of the effective susceptibility of each cell.

    So, if we call :math:`B_j` the magnetic field component on the receiver
    :math:`j`, and :math:`\bar{\chi}^{(i)} = (\chi_x^{(i)}, \chi_y^{(i)},
    \chi_z^{(i)})` the effective susceptibility of the active cell :math:`i`,
    then each row of the sensitivity matrix will be:

    .. math::

        \left[
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_x^{(1)}},
            \dots,
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_x^{(N)}},
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_y^{(1)}},
            \dots,
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_y^{(N)}},
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_z^{(1)}},
            \dots,
            \frac{\partial B_j}{\partial \chi_z^{(N)}}
        \right]

    where :math:`N` is the total number of active cells.
