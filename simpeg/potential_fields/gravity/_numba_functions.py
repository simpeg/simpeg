    Fill the sensitivity matrix

    This function should be used with a `numba.jit` decorator, for example:

    .. code::

        from numba import jit

        jit_function = jit(nopython=True, parallel=True)(_sensitivity_gravity_2d_mesh)

    Parameters
    ----------
    receivers : (n_receivers, 3) numpy.ndarray
        Array with the locations of the receivers
    cells_bounds : (n_active_cells, 4) numpy.ndarray
        Array with the bounds of each active cell in the 2D mesh. For each row, the
        bounds should be passed in the following order: ``x_min``, ``x_max``,
        ``y_min``, ``y_max``.
    top : (n_active_cells) np.ndarray
        Array with the top boundaries of each active cell in the 2D mesh.
    bottom : (n_active_cells) np.ndarray
        Array with the bottom boundaries of each active cell in the 2D mesh.
    sensitivity_matrix : (n_receivers, n_active_nodes) array
        Empty 2d array where the sensitivity matrix elements will be filled.
        This could be a preallocated empty array or a slice of it.
    forward_func : callable
        Forward function that will be evaluated on each node of the mesh. Choose
        one of the forward functions in ``choclo.prism``.
    constant_factor : float
        Constant factor that will be used to multiply each element of the
        sensitivity matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    The constant factor is applied here to each row of the sensitivity matrix
    because it's more efficient than doing it afterwards: it would require to
    index the rows that corresponds to each component.
